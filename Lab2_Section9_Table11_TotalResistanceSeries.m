% Lab #2:      Section 9- Different Levels of Resistance
% Description: Calculating the total resistance in series using the
% measured values and recording it in Table 11. 

%All 5 Measured resistor values in series circuit(Ω)
r1=98;
r2=981;
r3=97000; 

%Sum of all resistors 
rt= r1+r2+r3;

%Print the total sum in cmd 
fprintf('Total Resistance in Series: %g Ω',rt)
